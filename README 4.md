# #-the problem
# The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities.
# Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim of this data science project is to build a 
# predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store ,
# Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales
# #-hypothesis generation
# alternate hypothesis
#sales increase with low weight ,low fat content,high visibility,recent est.year,outlet size
# null hypothesis
#sales not related to item type,mrp,outlet location,outlet type
# #-loading data and packages
